# My Home Assistant
My homeassistant configuration. Includes automations for ikea lights, changing color based on (dynamic) time of day, multi-stage wake-up light sequence, as well as a polite Telegram bot named Dobby who can turn your lights off when you forgot and send you reminders.
Feel free to use whatever you find here for your own local Home Assistant or other home automation.
